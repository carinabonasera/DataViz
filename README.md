# DataViz
Hi! My name is Carina Bonasera and I am a sophomore at [**Lehigh University.**](http://www1.lehigh.edu/insidelehigh) I plan to major in science and environmental writing with a possible minor in graphic design. At Lehigh I work as an editorial assistant in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, as well as being involved in my sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta.

This repository is for projects done in my Data Visualization class. I hope to use it as a way to gain some experience in data visualization as well as to establish a portfolio to reference in the future.
